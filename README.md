# Let's THRASH!

Nothing feels better than getting things done.  Sometimes, however, it can be a challenge to motivate oneself to actually accomplish a day's tasks.

That’s where The Task Thrasher comes in.  Motivation through accumulating points is the name of the game.  The Task Thrasher allows users to establish a collection of tasks, give them a time requirement and a number of points based whatever the user considers one “segment” of time focused on the task.

The Task Thrasher is broken into four sections - Update Today, Add Points, Manage Tasks, and View Records.

## Update Today
This is the homepage of The Task Thrasher, where a day’s accumulated points are displayed.  A bar fills up and changes color as points are added.  Below the bar, there is a button allowing the user to POST the day’s points to the database, saving the changes forever.
It is important for any Thrasher to make sure to post the day’s points before midnight as there is no way to manually alter their information once the day has ended.

## Add Points
This page is where a user goes to add points for the day.  Each task is given its own button, describing the task’s name, its time allotment per section, an image or icon representing the task, and the point value of each click.
For instance, my Tasks include School Work, which I’ve decided is worth ten points for one hour of focus.  Ten solid hours of doing school work would fill my bar for the day, but it is mostly an unrealistic aim.  The other Tasks allow a robust variety of duties, all with varying values.
